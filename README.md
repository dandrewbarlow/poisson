# Poisson-Disc Sampling

by [Andrew Barlow](https://github.com/dandrewbarlow) | [website](https://a-barlow.com)

## Description

Object-oriented implementation of the Poisson Disc Sampling Algorithm. Inspired
by [the Coding Train's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flQgnCUxHlw), and
made using [the referenced
paper](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf).

The implementation is found in the file `Poisson.js`, and the sketch file shows
it in action with options provided for creating different effects. It could also
be used as a seed for other types of behavior.

Requires `p5.js` library.
